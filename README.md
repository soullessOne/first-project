# Classic Web Application Development with Spring WebMVC, Thymeleaf, and Jakarta Bean Validation

This repository contains the source code and materials for developing a classic web application using Spring WebMVC, Thymeleaf, and Jakarta Bean Validation.

## Introduction

In this project, we explore the development of a classic web application using Java technologies. We utilize Spring WebMVC for handling HTTP requests, Thymeleaf as the templating engine for generating HTML pages, and Jakarta Bean Validation for ensuring data integrity on the server-side.

## Technologies Used

- Spring WebMVC: A powerful framework for building web applications based on the Model-View-Controller architecture.
- Thymeleaf: A modern server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments.
- Jakarta Bean Validation: An API for Java EE and Jakarta EE applications to ensure that the data used by a web application meets the specified constraints.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`.
4. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the application.
